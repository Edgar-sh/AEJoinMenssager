## Features üî•
* **Fully Customizable Messages:** Take full control over the join messages. Every text, color, and format can be easily edited through external `JSON` files.

* **Multiple Message Types:** Greet players in two distinct ways at the same time:
    * **Public Join Message:** A configurable message in the public chat for everyone to see when a player logs in.
    * **On-Screen Title:** A large, customizable title and subtitle that appears directly on the joining player's screen for a high-impact welcome.

* **Dynamic Placeholders:** Personalize every message using the `{player}` placeholder, which is automatically replaced with the joining player's name.

* **Modern Text Formatting:** Built with the Kyori Adventure API, allowing for modern text features like RGB hex color codes (`#RRGGBB`) and text styles in your messages.

* **Easy Setup:** The plugin automatically generates the default `chat-messages.json` and `title-messages.json` files on the first launch, so you can start customizing immediately.

* **Robust and Stable:** Gracefully handles errors from malformed or missing configuration files without crashing the server, ensuring a smooth experience for server administrators.
